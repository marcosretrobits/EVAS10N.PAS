# EVAS10N.PAS
A Turbo Pascal rewrite of [Evas10n](https://retrobits.itch.io/evas10n), a BASIC 10-Liner breakout game for the ZX Spectrum.
EVAS10N.PAS has been entirely coded and compiled within the ZX Spectrum Next CP/M environment.

Files:
* EVAS10N.PAS: EVAS10N.PAS Turbo Pascal source code
* EVAS10N.COM: CP/M EVAS10N.PAS binary (compiled with Turbo Pascal 3.01A on the ZX Spectrum Next assuming 28MHz CPU)
* EVAS10N.EXE: DOS EVAS10N.PAS binary (compiled with Turbo Pascal 5.5 on DOSBox)

Note: to compile on DOS with Turbo Pascal 5.5, replace the "{$C-}" directive with "uses Crt, Turbo3;".
